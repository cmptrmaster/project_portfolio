            <h2>The Early Years</h2>
            <p id="earlyYears">
                I started out in college working towards an Electrical Engineering degree at the prestigeous Georgia Institute of Technology.
                I was accepted to other colleges and universities with excellent engineering schools, but GT was my first choice.  During my first year,
                I entered the Co-Op program and started working for a defense contractor.  Although the road to my degree was a little "rocky", I ended up 
                changing my major to Computer Science along the way.  Even though I had changed by major, my employer allowed me to stay while finishing up
                my degree.  I ended up staying with them for 20+ years, along with acquiring my Master's degree (MSCIS).<br><br>
            
                While working for them, I managed their network, servers, PCs, printers, firewalls, databases, phones... if it was infrastructure, my hands were
                on it.  I changed their entire network from ArcNet to Ethernet, moved then from Novell NetWare to Microsoft NT, managed all the hardware and software
                and everything in between.  I worked my way up to the site IT Manager and was in that position for a few years.  I managed a small team - a PC technician and
                a Web developer, but we only had about 200 people at the site.  Due to situations outside my control, I had to move on to other things.

            <p id="sincethen">
                After leaving the DoD contractor, I started working for the City of Tallahassee, Florida.  When I walked in the door in 2011, I had never touched VMware,
                storage arrays, storage area networks, Citrix or other major infrastructure components.  But in the first few years, I became one of their go-to people
                on those same systems.  I turned into the senior engineer on our support team.  I lead of team of 4 other engineers and train them on the systems I support
                so they will also be able to support them and grow in their careers as I did.  I work with the network team to architect our datacenter resources for our
                internal customers and for our public citizens.  We maintain a 99.999% uptime through our careful planning and deployment of enterprise class resources.
